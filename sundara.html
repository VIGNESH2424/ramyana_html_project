<h1>sundara Kanda</h1>
<p style="color:black;">Sundara Kaanda  is the <b>fifth</b> book in the Hindu epic, the Ramayana. The original Sundara Kanda is in Sanskrit and was composed by <b>Valmiki</b>, who was the first to scripturally record the Ramayana. Sundara Kanda is the only chapter of the Ramayana in which the hero is not Rama, but rather Hanuman. The work depicts the adventures of Hanuman and his selflessness, strength, and devotion to Rama are emphasized in the text. Hanuman was fondly called “Sundara” by his mother Anjani and Sage Valmiki chose this name over others as the Sundara Kanda is about Hanuman's journey to Lanka.</p>
